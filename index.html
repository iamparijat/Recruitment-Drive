            <p>As one of the oldest universities of the country, Jadavpur University, and its students have a certain duty - the duty to give back to society across all disciplines and inculcate the habit of thinking in every individual who comes along. The IEEE Jadavpur University Student Branch is one little endeavor in that process. Founded in 2010, we belong to the Kolkata section of Region 10 of the organization. One of the most active student branches in our section, we are dedicated to furthering technical and entrepreneurial innovations through hands-on interactive sessions. With large scale events and intimate, basic workshops, we try to keep something happening all year round - so that the fire of knowledge, learning and innovation never burns out. In this process of sharing our love for technology, we have slowly grown, met new people, evolved as a group and built around us, a community of like-minded individuals who are driven by a passion for learning and giving back to society..</p>

                A design team is a department in an organization or brand that develops the creative plan for the organization's products or services. Team members in this department perform specific roles using different tools to create quality projects. Examples of projects that design departments participate in include the development of software applications and architectural projects. Team members in a design unit usually differ based on the nature of the project or organization. 

               These professionals create a comprehensive blueprint to guide the whole project execution process. A design manager supervises the activities of team members and ensures that they develop marketable designs to generate profit.

            PR is used in marketing mostly to maintain good media relations and public image, build brand awareness, and engage with potential brand promoters – from sponsors to influencers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Public relations is the practice of managing the spread of information between an individual or an organization and the public.
        <br>
        Public relations professionals are responsible for building and maintaining relationships with the public, as well as managing communications between various parties.
        <br>
      The goal of public relations is to shape how people think about a company, product, service, or person. It’s about telling a story that resonates with your target audience and engages them in a professional dialogue that is consistent with the company’s culture and values.
